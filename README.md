[https://drive.google.com/drive/download/](https://drive.google.com/drive/download/)

Install all desired utilities from `2-Utilities/` for optmization

Run each one and personalize according your prefferences.



### Step 6: 📄 Choose the Templates

Alternatively, you can pick a configuration template from `3-Templates/` for use with the Utilities.

Review and apply these templates, or create your own using each utility.




### Step 7: 🚀 Performance Testing

Run a first-time performance test to serve as a baseline for future improvements.

After each change, you can run additional tests to evaluate the effect on DCS and PC performance.

<img width="2080" height="1369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de6292e-2b4c-4ce8-b824-4f98c5bf5bec" />


#### Open and configure **.\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.1-dcs-testing-configuration.ini**

<img width="1338" height="1488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b86726bc-22ca-464e-b60c-4f2d8c08cc40" />

#### Running Tests

1) Edit the Configuration, setting what tests you wanna run
2) Click Start Benchmark
3) Notepad++ will openfor log and progression display
4) Pimax wil open (if you fly VR, only Pimax integrated yet, other headsets to come)
5) CapFrameX will open record the data of the tests
6) DCS will open running a standard F18 Mission (you might add your own mission) looping trough all tests
7) After all tests run. you can compare performance results in CapFrameX

<img width="3838" height="2149" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4074b71a-6b33-42df-be2a-6459492f9016" />


#### Benchmark Configuration
```powershell
# Configure DCS graphics settings for comprehensive performance testing
# Edit the benchmark configuration file:
notepad .\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.1-dcs-testing-configuration.ini

# Features:
# - 868-line comprehensive configuration file
# - Covers all DCS graphics options (AA, MSAA, SSAO, SSLR, shadows, lighting)
# - Performance impact documentation for each setting
# - Optimized presets for different hardware configurations
# - VR-specific optimization settings
```

In this file, you can set wich configurations you want to test in DCS

<img width="991" height="880" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52dceb0-7d90-412c-8728-c129cb6311c8" />
For the image above, we are testing (uncommented lines):
 - anisotropy values ranging from 1,2,4,8 to 16 and requiring DCS restart
 - canopyReflections values ranging from 0,0.50,0.75,0.88 to 1.00 requiring NO DCS restart
 - chimneySmokeDensity values ranging from 0,5,8,9,10 requiring NO DCS restart

So the script will:
0) Store current value for **anisotropy** in options.lua
1) Change the DCS  value from current value to **anisotropy =1** in options.lua
2) Start DCS and run a pre recorded mission track
3) repeat the test X times as set in the scritp file (_.\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.2-dcs-testing-automation.ahk_)
4) Close DCS and return **anisotropy** to its original value
5) Move on to the next tests
    - anisotropy=2
    - anisotropy=4
    - anisotropy=8
    - anisotropy=16
    - canopyReflections=0
    - canopyReflections=0.5
    - and so on...
6) After all tests are completed, DCS will be closed. All progress is recorded in the log file (`.\\4-Performance-Testing\\4.1.2-dcs-testing-automation.log`), which is also displayed during tests

```powershell
# Configure the Tests to be run
# Uncomment the desired test lines
.\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.1-dcs-testing-configuration.ini

# Review script configuration
# Open the script in a text editor and check if:
# - Paths are correct
# - Waiting times are correct (THEY VARY FROM PC TO PC - YOU MUST MEASURE YOURS!)
# - Mouse Left button --> Edit with Notepad++
.\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.2-dcs-testing-automation.ahk

# Run automated DCS performance testing with CapFrameX integration
# Double-click the script to run
.\4-Performance-Testing\4.1.2-dcs-testing-automation.ahk

# Features:
# - 1171-line AutoHotkey v2.0 automation script
# - Configurable timing for different system performance levels
# - Multiple benchmark runs per setting (default: 3 runs)
# - Automatic retry mechanism for failed operations
# - VR support with Pimax Play integration
# - Automated mission loading and testing
# - 120-second benchmark recordings per test
# - CapFrameX JSON data collection
```

### Step 5: 🛠️ Performance Testing and Logging

Prior to DCS open and run the track, supporting applications will be open:

#### Notepadd++ 
Displaying the log in real time

# Features:
# - Detailed timestamped logging of all benchmark operations
# - Performance data collection and analysis
# - Error reporting and retry tracking
# - Benchmark completion status and results summary
# - Compatible with external log analysis tools
```

#### CapFrameX 
CapFrameX that will capture tests results during DCS track play
Pay attention to the detection of the DCS process, and also for the **Capturing** clue at the lower left corner when DCS is capturing
IMPORTANT: you have to change the default RecordKey in CapFrameX from "F11" to **"SCROLL LOCK"** to avoid DCS conflicts.
