# DCS-Max Performance Optimizations Configuration
# Version: 1.0.0
# 
# This file controls which optimizations are applied when running the
# optimization scripts. Edit manually or use the DCS-Max UI.
#
# Format (inspired by O&O ShutUp10):
#   ID	+	# Description
#   ID	-	# Description (disabled)
#
# + = Optimization enabled (will be applied)
# - = Optimization disabled (will be skipped)
#
# Categories:
#   R = Registry optimizations (14 items)
#   S = Windows Services (44 items)
#   T = Scheduled Tasks (60 items)
#   C = Cache cleaning (5 items)
