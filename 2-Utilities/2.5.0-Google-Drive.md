# Google Drive Weekly Backup Integration

**Automated cloud backup for DCS configurations and optimization settings**

## 📋 **Overview**

Google Drive provides reliable cloud storage for backing up your DCS configurations, but if kept running can reduce system thrust and introduce stutters. The DCS-Max suite includes automated scheduling templates to run Google Drive only once a week—balancing peak game performance and backup safety, so your rig stays at full thrust and your settings are always protected.

│   ├── Documents/Tacview                   # Tacview files
│   ├── Documents/DCS-Max-Backups/   # DCS configuration backups
```

### **Step 3: Import Automation Template**
1. **Open Task Scheduler** as Administrator
2. **Import Task** → Browse to `3-Templates/3.5.0-dcs-google-drive-weekly-backup.xml`
3. **Modify paths** in the task to match your Google Drive location
4. **Test execution** manually before enabling automatic schedule
